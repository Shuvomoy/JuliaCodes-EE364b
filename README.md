# Julia Codes for EE364b
These are Julia codes that I am creating while studying materials from Professor Boyd's course [EE364b: Convex Optimization](http://stanford.edu/class/ee364b/). The goal is to reproduce the numerical examples using [JuliaOpt](http://www.juliaopt.org/). This is a work in progress.
