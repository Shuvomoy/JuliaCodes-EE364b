# Julia Codes for EE364b
These are Julia codes that I am creating while self-studying Professor S. Boyd's course [EE364b: Convex Optimization](http://stanford.edu/class/ee364b/). The goal is to reproduce some of the numerical examples described in the course material using [JuliaOpt](http://www.juliaopt.org/). This is a work in progress.
